Best results with 10 robots. Screenshots show of the robots flocked together and moving
and comm range of 15 and 20 * radius

My code seems to be working for all the required vectors : 
-Migration
-Separation
-Cohesion 
-Alignment (the better part)
-Random walk

All these vectors are implemented as described in the paper.
The observed problems with the behaviour of my robots, which I have not had the time to troubleshoot (and will continue to look at in the coming days) are the following : 
-the robots follow a general heading once they group up
-they often get stuck together 
-random walk is needed to separate them 
-random walk might also be aggravating the effect of them grouping up together

Since the last project I worked on my algorithm to make sure it was calculating the vectors for all neihgbours, especially on alignment, cohesion and separation. At each time step these are summed up.
